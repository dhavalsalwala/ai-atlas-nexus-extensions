Human jailbreak strategies reveal weaknesses that: Static rules miss, Automated tests can’t anticipate, Only emerge through interaction and persuasion. They are essential for building AI systems that are: Safer in the wild, More trustworthy, More resilient to misuse"

The evaluator directly requests the model to do something that should trigger safeguards instead of disguising intent or using complex prompts. Direct Request tests whether: Safety policies are correctly enforced, Refusal behavior is consistent, The model avoids hallucinated compliance, The model provides safe alternatives when appropriate."
